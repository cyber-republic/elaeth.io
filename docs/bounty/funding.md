Our DAO named **Cyber Republic (CR)** is always looking for new DApps that would benefit the Elastos ecosystem, there is no 
requirement to be exclusive to Elastos. The only real requirement is to prove to the community that your DApp will
bring a positive benefit to our ecosystem. 

## Getting Funding


#### 1. Reach out to the ETH Task Force Team advisor at clarence@elastos.org and discuss your idea

Not sure if your idea qualifies for funding or looking for someone to bounce ideas off of? Clarence Liu 
the Elastos VP of Development is happy to discuss your idea and provide feedback before you create the proposal. 


#### 2. Create a Cyber Republic Suggestion at [www.cyberrepublic.org/suggestion](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/suggestion) to raise your idea to the community

An official **CR Suggestion** is the first step in the Cyber Republic Consensus process, the **"Suggestion"** is a detailed
initial proposal created on our official website at www.cyberrepublic.org. **It is voted upon by the community and the 
CR Council** and must clearly define the Goals, Motivation, Implementation Plan and Budget. 

Therefore we hope you reach out to us first and discuss your project, so we can help you craft the best **Suggestion** 
possible to pitch your project to the community.

*Therefore we hope you reach out to us first and discuss your idea so we can guide you on the process.*  


#### 3. Wait for feedback or contact a CR Council member listed at [www.cyberrepublic.org/council](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/council)

After creating your Suggestion the interim council gauges the community feedback via the likes and dislikes received by
your Suggestion. If your Suggestion is viewed positively by the community or the council member thinks your project
stands out they will convert your Suggestion into a **[Proposal](https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals)**.
