title: Faucet - Get Free Test ETH
sidebar_label: Get Free Test ETH

In the blockchain world we have a name for the service which provides free test tokens, which is called a **"Faucet"**.

The point of the faucet is to provide you with free test tokens to interact with the blockchain, otherwise development
would be far too difficult because you'd need to ask the test miners for tokens.
