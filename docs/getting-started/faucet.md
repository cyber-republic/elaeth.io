title: Faucet - Get Free Test ETH
sidebar_label: Get Free Test ETH
---

In the blockchain world we have a name for the service which provides free test tokens, which is called a **"Faucet"**.

The point of the faucet is to provide you with free test tokens to interact with the blockchain, otherwise development
would be far too difficult because you'd need to ask the test miners for tokens.

You can get tokens from [ELA ETH Faucet site](https://faucet.elaeth.io). After passing google's reCAPTCHA verification, enter your ETH compatible address and click `REQUEST 0.1 ELA ETH` button, you will get 0.1 ELA ETH.
